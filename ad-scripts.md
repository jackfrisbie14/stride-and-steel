# Ad Campaign — Hormozi Principles + Micro-Budget Testing

## Why the Last Campaign Failed

1. **No Lead pixel event** — Meta optimized for PageView/link clicks, not quiz completions
2. **Creatives didn't show the product** — Triathlon photos don't explain what Stride & Steel is
3. **Hook too narrow** — "Training for your first marathon?" excludes 90% of hybrid athletes
4. **AI UGC killed trust** — People spot synthetic faces
5. **Only 2 creatives on $425** — Should test 4-6 hooks at $50-75 each, kill losers fast

## Hormozi Principles Applied

- **Give value first** — The quiz/archetype reveal IS the lead magnet. Ads drive curiosity, not sales.
- **Hook -> Retain -> Reward** — 3s hook, 10-15s value, CTA with low risk.
- **Show the product** — Screen recordings, not lifestyle photos.
- **Specificity** — "$12.50/month" not "affordable." "30-second quiz" not "quick quiz."

## Creative 1: "Which Type Are You?" (Screen Recording — Curiosity)

**Angle:** Pure curiosity. No selling. People want to know their "type."
**Format:** 9:16, no talking head, captions on, clean screen recording + text overlays

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK**
Text overlay: "There are 5 types of hybrid athletes. Which one are you?"

**[0:03-0:12] RETAIN**
Screen recording — tap through quiz questions -> analyzing animation -> archetype reveal with ratio bars

**[0:12-0:18] REWARD**
Text: "Free 30-second quiz -> Find your type" + CTA button

### Ad Copy

**Primary text:**
There are 5 types of hybrid athletes.

The Iron Runner. The Steel Strider. The Balanced Athlete. The Endurance Machine. The Power Hybrid.

Each one trains differently. Each one has different strengths and blind spots.

Free 30-second quiz tells you your type and builds your training plan around it.

**Headline:** Which hybrid athlete type are you?
**Description:** Free 30-second quiz. No card required.

## Creative 2: "The Math" (Talking Head — Value)

**Angle:** Price comparison. Make the value undeniable.
**Format:** 9:16, talking head + product B-roll, captions on

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK (Seated, to camera)**
"A running coach costs $300 a month. A personal trainer costs $400. What if you could get both for twelve fifty?"

**[0:03-0:15] RETAIN (Cut to screen recording)**
Dashboard -> workout card -> exercise demo GIF -> weight tracking

**[0:15-0:22] REWARD (Back to camera)**
"Free 7-day trial. If you don't PR in 90 days, you train free."

### Ad Copy

**Primary text:**
What personalized coaching actually costs:
-> Running coach: $200-300/month
-> Personal trainer (2x/week): $400-600/month
-> Both: $600-900/month

Stride & Steel gives you both — personalized running + lifting programs, exercise demos, weight tracking — for $12.50/month on the annual plan.

Free 7-day trial. PR or train free.

**Headline:** Two coaches. $12.50/month.
**Description:** Free 7-day trial. PR-or-Free guarantee.

## Creative 3: "The Interference Problem" (Talking Head — Educational)

**Angle:** Educational = high save/share rate. Teach something, then offer the solution.
**Format:** 9:16, mostly talking head

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK (Seated)**
"If you run and lift, you're probably making this mistake."

**[0:03-0:18] RETAIN**
Explain concurrent training interference — hard run + heavy leg day back to back = slower AND weaker. The fix is session sequencing, not training less. Cut to weekly plan screenshot.

**[0:18-0:25] REWARD**
"Stride and Steel does this automatically. Free quiz builds your whole week."

### Ad Copy

**Primary text:**
Running hard the day before leg day doesn't just make your legs tired — it actively blocks muscle growth. It's called concurrent training interference.

The fix isn't training less. It's session sequencing — spacing your hard runs and heavy lifts so they amplify each other instead of competing.

Stride & Steel does this automatically. Take a 30-second quiz, get a full week of workouts where your runs and lifts are programmed together.

**Headline:** Stop letting your runs kill your gains
**Description:** Free quiz -> personalized hybrid plan. 30 seconds.

## Creative 4: "Full Walkthrough" (Screen Recording — Demo)

**Angle:** Show everything. For people who need to see the product before clicking.
**Format:** 9:16, no talking head, text overlays + background music

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK**
Text: "This $20/month app replaced my running coach and personal trainer"

**[0:03-0:20] RETAIN**
Full walkthrough: quiz -> archetype -> dashboard -> lift workout -> exercise GIF -> run workout -> weight tracking -> progress bar

**[0:20-0:25] REWARD**
Text: "Free 7-day trial. PR or train free."

### Ad Copy

**Primary text:**

## Creative 5: "I Wasted 6 Months" (Talking Head — Problem)

**Angle:** Personal story. Relatable pain point.
**Format:** 9:16, talking head + optional B-roll

**[0:00-0:03] HOOK (Seated)**
"I wasted six months training for a triathlon before I figured this out."

**[0:03-0:15] RETAIN**
Running 5 days, random lifting, always tired, getting slower. Problem wasn't effort — zero programming. Runs killing lifts, lifts killing runs.

**[0:15-0:22] REWARD**
"So I built an app that fixes this. Free quiz, 30 seconds. Link below."

### Ad Copy

**Primary text:**
I spent 6 months training for a triathlon with zero structure.

Running 5 days a week. Random lifting on the side. Always tired, always sore, getting slower at both.

The problem wasn't effort — it was programming. My runs were killing my lifts and my lifts were killing my runs.

So I built Stride & Steel. Take a 30-second quiz, get a full hybrid training plan where everything works together.

Free 7-day trial. If you don't PR in 90 days, you train free.

**Headline:** I built the app I wish I had
**Description:** Free quiz -> personalized hybrid plan. 30 seconds.
