## Static 2: "Get Stronger and Faster — or It's Free"

**utm_content:** `static_guarantee`

**Primary Text:**
Most hybrid athletes don't have a programming problem. They have a sequencing problem — hard runs before heavy lifts, no recovery structure, no progression.

Stride & Steel fixes that. AI builds your entire training week around your hybrid athlete type — every run, every lift, every rest day programmed together.
